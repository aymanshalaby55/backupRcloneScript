Backup Script - Google Drive Backup Utility

USAGE:
    backup [OPTIONS] <file_or_directory>

DESCRIPTION:
    Compresses and backs up files or directories to Google Drive using rclone.
    The script creates a timestamped tar.gz archive and uploads it to gdrive:Backups.

OPTIONS:
    --login, -l
        Configure rclone for Google Drive authentication.
        Sets up the 'gdrive' remote for the first time.
        
    --logs, -L
        Display the backup log file.
        Shows the contents of /var/backup.log if it exists.
        
    --help, -h
        Display this help message.

ARGUMENTS:
    <file_or_directory>
        Path to the file or directory you want to backup.
        The script will compress it before uploading.

EXAMPLES:
    # Backup a directory
    backup /home/user/documents
    
    # Backup a single file
    backup /home/user/important.txt
    
    # Configure Google Drive authentication
    backup --login
    
    # View backup logs
    backup --logs

NOTES:
    - Backups are stored in /var/Backup temporarily during compression
    - Compressed archives are uploaded to gdrive:Backups on Google Drive
    - Log file is located at /var/backup.log
    - The temporary backup directory is cleaned up after upload

REQUIREMENTS:

    - Google Drive remote must be set up (use --login)
